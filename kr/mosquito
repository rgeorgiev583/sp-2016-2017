Isis - Life Under the Swatter

This is Mosquito Control:
I'm on the stinging end.
Your tongue is spilling pins,
Vector of the secret disease.
Your voice is like a rusted plane,
In a rusted sky.

Your beak pierces me
In the back of my neck
Your skin
Erupts my skin into a rash.

This is Mosquito Control:
I'm on the stinging end
I'm on the stinging end.

Mosquito Control:
Life under the swatter!
(Never turn your back!
Never close your eyes!)

Pulling wings;
Tight strip to paralyze.
Mosquito Control:
Breed in stagnant warmth.

Mating of the swarm;
Mating of the filth.
(Blood for breeds,
Dripping poisoned mouths)
Thin the swarm population;
Controlling stingers
Suck you dry;
Digging needle deep.

Leaving poison:
Itch.
Digging.
Mosquito Control...
Population Control...
Exterminate the swarm, on wings and needles.

SUCK ME DRY, BLEED ME DRY.
